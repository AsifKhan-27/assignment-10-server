      "details": "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name Python is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python. Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details. Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability. Additionally, Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code. Python is an open source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries and functionality for it."

      "details": "Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages. One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to write once, run anywhere. It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. Javascript does not need to be compiled, while Java code does need to be compiled. Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers while Java can be run anywhere. New and improved software development tools are coming to market at a remarkable pace, displacing incumbent products once thought to be indispensable. In light of this continual turnover, Java’s longevity is impressive; more than two decades after its creation, Java is still the most popular language for application software development—developers continue to choose it over languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, C++, and others. As a result, Java remains an important requirement for competing in the job market."

According to Web Technology Surveys, PHP is used by 78.1% of all websites, including high-traffic websites like Facebook and Wikipedia. Anyone can benefit from learning about PHP, but it is even more essential for those interested in web programming. PHP is available on all major operating systems, such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Most web servers, including Apache and IIS, also support PHP. One of the main benefits of using PHP is advancing the customization of a WordPress site. Other features include great online support and documentation, so even beginners can learn PHP quickly. This article will go over the basics of PHP. By the end of it, you will understand the full benefits of PHP and how to utilize it in WordPress. PHP is a versatile scripting language that is great for both beginners and experts. PHP is also regularly updated to follow the latest technology trends. According to PopularitY of Programming Language, PHP is listed as the number six most popular computer language. PHP is the language behind all WordPress plugins and themes. Knowing how to use PHP will improve your customization options. For example, if WordPress directories don’t have a design or tool you need for your website, you can simply create one with PHP. "

      "details": "The C language is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It provides a straightforward, consistent, powerful interface for programming systems. That's why the C language is widely used for developing system software, application software, and embedded systems. The C programming language has been highly influential, and many other languages have been derived from it. For example, C++ and Java are two popular modern dialects of C. And C is an excellent choice for system programming, for example, developing operating systems, compilers, and network drivers. Despite its popularity, C is not without its criticisms. Some have argued that its syntax could be more complex and easier to learn, while others have noted its lack of standardization as a significant issue. Nevertheless, C remains a widely used and influential language and will probably continue for many years. C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation in the process of learning any other programming language. Operating systems and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems are examples of such applications."

      "details": "C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources. Some call C++ C with classes because it introduces object-oriented programming principles, including the use of defined classes, to the C programming language framework. Over time, C++ has remained a very useful language not only in computer programming itself, but in teaching new programmers about how object-oriented programming works. However, it does not support only object-oriented, but also procedural and functional. Thanks to its high flexibility and scalability, C++ can be used to develop a broad range of software, applications, browsers, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), operating systems, and games. Today C++ is still very appreciated for its notable portability which allows developers to create programs that can run on different operating systems or platforms very easily. Despite being a high-level language, since C++ is still close to C it can be used for low-level manipulation due to its close relation with machine language. "

C# is primarily used on the Windows .NET framework, although it can be applied to an open source platform. This highly versatile programming language is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) and comparably new to the game, yet a reliable crowd pleaser. Like other general-purpose programming languages, C# can be used to create a number of different programs and applications: mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud-based services, websites, enterprise software and games. Lots and lots of games. While C# is remarkably versatile, there are three areas in which it is most commonly used. C# was created by Microsoft for Microsoft, so it’s easy to see why it’s most popularly used for the development of Windows desktop applications. C# applications require the Windows .NET framework in order to function at their best, so the strongest use case for this language is developing applications and programs that are specific to the architecture of the Microsoft platform.
